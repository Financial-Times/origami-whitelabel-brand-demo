# Customised Origami Components Demo

This demo shows how to customise whitelabel Origami components with Sass. In particular how to set a custom font, typographic scale, and headings. This demo does not show how a project should be set up and built, and should not be viewed as a project boilerlate. It is also not a replacement for component documentation (e.g. see [o-typography in the registry](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/o-typography/readme#customisation)).

- [Demo Sass](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-whitelabel-brand-demo/blob/master/main.scss)
- [Demo Markup](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-whitelabel-brand-demo/tree/master/public)

All built assets are included in this demo. To preview the result open `/public/index.html` in your browser.

To build Sass changes locally, install [Origami Build Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/origami-build-tools) and run `make build`.
