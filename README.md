# Origami Whitelabel Brand Demo

This project demonstrates how to customise whitelabel Origami components with Sass. In particular how to set a custom font, typographic scale, and headings. This project does not show how a project should be set up or built, and should not be viewed as a project boilerlate.

- [Demo Sass](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-whitelabel-brand-demo/blob/master/main.scss)
- [Demo Markup](https://github.com/Financial-Times/origami-whitelabel-brand-demo/tree/master/public)

All built assets are included in this demo. To preview the result open `/public/index.html` in your browser.

To build Sass changes locally, install [Origami Build Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/origami-build-tools) and run `make build`.
